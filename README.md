# Global Gamers Challenge - Power Cut

## What it does
This game is quite simple and cannot be won. The goal of the game is to last as many game days as possible. The game will gradually speed up and the player needs to turn off the lights in the houses in the morning. The larger the house, the more electricity it consumes. The more lights on, the more carbon dioxide emissions. Also, if the player turns off the lights at night, he will receive negative points from people. The more light was turned on, the more negative points the user will receive.

## How I built it
The implementation was chosen in a hurry, the reason for which is Rive. The game works using Flame and a lot of pictures.

Looks more interesting on devices with a big screen, as the game scales the interface and looks nicer and more pleasant :)
